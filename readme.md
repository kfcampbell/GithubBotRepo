# Github Bot Project

I know they got rid of streaks, but this is a bot I made to play with Github's API to post a new file every day.

## Usage
Create a new repo, then start a screen on your server and run a cron job to run the GithubUpdate.py script each day.

## Things It Would Be Nice To Add

* a better way to construct a JSON request than just string manipulation
* simply update a single file rather than add a new file each time
